                    <h2>Salinas, CA</h2>
                    <p>
                      I was born and raised in Salinas, CA, the lettuce capital in the world. It is located in Central California, roughly 45 minutes south of San Jose. 
                      Growing up in Salinas has advised me so much about life, respect, and commitment. Crime rate can be high throughout the years but has gradually begun to decrease in recent years. 
                      About 75.5 percent of the people living in Salinas are Hispanic, and the majority of them come here for a more competent life just as my parents did. Driving early in the morning in Salinas will display the hard-working Mexican workers going to work every morning to provide for their families. 
                      That motivated me to start working at an early age in High School and begin to provide for myself.  </p>
                      <p>Below displays some of my hobbies and future career goals!</p>

                    <p>
                      Ever see that person that is screaming at the TV and calling the plays while watching sports...Well, that's me. As long as I can remember I have always had a passion for sports. I grew up playing baseball and soccer for 10 years and later began playing basketball in local city leagues. Being from Salinas, Bay Area Sports was our closest sports network we had so my two brothers and I grew up rooting for the 49ers and Giants. It was not till later when I began watching the Warriors play around 2008 and instantly became a huge fan of the team and the sport. In regards to Football or soccer here in the states, Arsenal is my football club. I have been lucky enough to have attended a World Series game in 2014, which is unquestionably my all-time favorite sports moment.                     </p>

                    <h2>Twitch & Dream Job</h2>
                    <p>
                      When I am not competing in sports or trying to learn any new programming languages, I am usually playing video games. The first console I remember having my hands on was the Nintendo 64. My brothers would always play Zelda and Smash Bros at the time and I was doing my best to annoy them to let me play. After that console generation diminished, the PlayStation one and two were the two consoles where I remember the most playing when growing up. It was not until I got my very own Xbox when I began recognizing my passion for video games. Games like Halo and Gears of War were games that brought out the competitiveness of video games with its online capability. As of now, I am trying to get into PC gaming more, but am still playing my Xbox one from time to time with my friends. <p>A few years ago, I began watching Twitch and ever since has become my primary source of entertainment. I was reluctant to watch Twitch because I thought it was bizarre to see people play video games. I decided to give it a shot one day and was hooked immediately. The built communities from each channel make Twitch so diverse and great that anyone who loves playing video games should try. My dream job would be to work at Twitch as a Data Analyst, and hope to one day get that opportunity. </p>                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We have a family dog named Chewbacca and is literally the center of attention at home. He is a mixed breed of a Shih-Tzu and Yorkie. We have had him for about 7 years and to this day acts like a baby, but we still adore him of course. Since he came into our lives, he has induced more happiness in our home. Before it would get quiet and boring, but not with him around. It actually took a while to figure out his name, but I don't know why I struggled to figure it out, he literally looks like a mini Chewy.                     </p>
